      <h3>💫 6 September 2023 — The Day We Met 💫</h3>
      <p>
        It’s funny how sometimes one random day can completely change your entire life — a single date that becomes the reason behind every smile, every heartbeat, every dream.
        For me, that day was 6th September 2023 — the day I met you, my Doha, my jaan, my everything. ❤️
      </p>
      <p>
        When I think about it now, it still feels unreal. That first time we talked… I didn’t know that moment would lead to something so beautiful. You came into my life so unexpectedly, and from the very beginning, it felt like I already knew you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You had that rare magic — the kind that makes even ordinary words sound like music. I remember being nervous at first — like, what should I say, what if I say something stupid — but the moment you laughed, everything felt easy. That laugh, ya Allah, it just melted everything around me.
      </p>
      <p>
        You made me feel like I mattered. That day wasn’t just the start of a conversation — it was the beginning of a story. Our story. The kind that people dream of but rarely get to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since that day, nothing has felt the same. You became my comfort, my motivation, my person. You taught me that love isn’t just about grand gestures — it’s about kindness, consistency, and care. ❤️
      </p>

      <h3>🎂 19 October — My Jaan’s Birthday 🎂</h3>
      <p>
        Every year has 365 days, but for me, 19th October is the most special one — because it’s the day my Doha was born. My sweet, beautiful, kind-hearted queen. The day the world was blessed with the most precious soul.
      </p>
      <p>
        When your birthday comes, it’s not just a celebration for you; it’s a celebration for me too. Because that day gave me you. 💖
      </p>
      <p>
        On your birthday, I don’t just wish you happiness — I pray for your peace, your dreams, your endless joy. You’ve changed me in ways I can’t explain. You made me believe that love can exist even in distance — that it can cross oceans and time zones and still feel strong.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when I think of 19th October, I don’t just see a date — I see you. The one who turned my life into a story worth living. 🌙
